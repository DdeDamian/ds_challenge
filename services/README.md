# Services

Here I'm going to list the micro-services used for the project.

- [Services](#services)
  - [frontend](#frontend)

## frontend

This micro-service is in charge of present us a small web page showing us a "Hello world" message along some other information to show the content of some variables from different sources.

More details on the service implementation here [frontend-service](./frontend/README.md)
